For corporate design services, you will need to fill out the branding questionnaire that will help us discover more about your brand. Our ability to complete a project also hinges largely on your response time. We rely on your feedback to create a great piece of work, so the sooner you respond to us, the faster we can move forward.</p>

That's why we take extra care to make sure you are satisfied throughout the process. The first step of our process is to have a design consultation call to make sure the partnership is a good fit. We want to make sure that your vision is something we can create for you. If it is not in our wheelhouse, we will let you know right away. Once designs are started, we offer 2 rounds of revisions with all our services where the feedback and issues are ironed out. However, we do not offer refunds due to the nature of the business. 100% of our clients have been happy with our work and we have had a good track record so far.</p>

In any case, we will let you know what to expect during our initial discussion.</p>

                    <p>We offer up to 2 rounds of revisions with all our services. We will initially provide a pencil sketch on which you can provide your feedback. This is the 1st round of revision. Once finalized, our talented artists will doodle the final design with ink. We will send you a work-in-progress photograph of the final doodle on which you may suggest minor additions. This is the 2nd round of revision. Due to the nature of the service, we will not be able to edit the final doodle but only add to what has already been doodled. Therefore, it is important that you provide all major feedback during the 1st revision.</p>
